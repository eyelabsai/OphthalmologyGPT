## Steps (Mainly Changes Required) for Running Notebook
1. Run all the installation commands (assuming the "!pip" syntax does not work for you) and check that they run correctly
2. Change Wills Eye Manual PDF path, currently a Kaggle Path
3. Add some Prompts (comma separated strings, where the strings themselves would be the prompts) to the variable "prompts"

Also, shall we call it OphthalmologyGPT or OphthaLLMology? ;)
